							'<p>Our Offshore Supply Vessels (“<strong>OSV</strong>”) division has one of the youngest fleets of mid-water and deepwater Anchor Handling Tug Supply (“<strong>AHTS</strong>”) vessels and Platform Supply Vessels (“<strong>PSV</strong>”). Besides undertaking towing and anchor handling of drilling rigs, these multifunctional vessels also provide logistical support during the exploration, field development, construction and production phases of the oil and gas life cycle. The vessels in our fleet are equipped with advanced Dynamic Positioning (“<strong>DP</strong>”) technology, which enables safe and efficient operations in close quarters. These new generation vessels are also designed with fuel-efficient diesel electric propulsion and possess Clean Design and Green Passport notation which reduce and limit the vessels’ combustion machinery emissions and accidental sea pollution. Our OSV division operates:</p>' +
							'<p>	• 	AHTS of up to 200 tonne bollard pull providing multi-role services during drilling such as towing and positioning of drilling rigs, as well as transporting drilling materials and other equipment</p>' +
							'<p>	• 	PSVs that transport drilling materials and supplies to drilling rigs and offshore production platforms as well as pipes and other materials for the construction of marine structures or pipelines</p>' +
							'<p>With our young and modern fleet, we are committed to serving our global network of customers, including super majors and national oil and gas companies. We continue to uphold our proven international track record, operating across Asia Pacific, Africa, Middle East and Latin America.</p>'

							'<h3>Transportation &amp; Installation</h3>' +
							'<p>Our Transportation & Installation (“<strong>T&I</strong>”) division supports marine contractors worldwide in the construction and maintenance of oilfield infrastructure and pipelines. </p><p>In shallow waters, the division operates a fleet of ocean towing tugs and Anchor Handling Tugs (“<strong>AHT</strong>”) of up to 8,000 BHP, which are primarily engaged to support pipelay and platform construction work. In addition, our shallow water T&I department operates submersible barges (up to 30,500 dwt) for float-over or for launching operations of large marine structures and ballastable flat top barges ranging from 250 to 330 feet, as well as tugs for transportation of construction materials and subsea pipes. </p><p>Meanwhile, our deepwater operations are managed by our specialist offshore service contractor joint venture, POSH Terasea, which operates the largest deepwater AHT fleet globally comprising tugs of 150 to 200 tonne bollard pull each. These ocean-going tugs are designed with high bollard pull and large fuel tanks that enable them to perform large tows, such as for Floating Production Storage and Offloading (“<strong>FPSO</strong>”) and Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (“<strong>FLNG</strong>”) vessels across long distances economically, without multiple refuelling stops. Leveraging our full suite of vessels, POSH is known as a leading operator in the deepwater T&I space, having successfully completed many demanding ocean towage projects over the past decade.</p>'

							'<p>The Offshore Accommodation (“<strong>OA</strong>”) division operates a fleet of vessels that deliver a wide range of accommodation and “walk-to-work” solutions for large numbers of offshore professionals involved in the construction and maintenance of offshore oil field structures and platforms.</p>' +
							'<p>We are focused on providing a variety of high-specification offshore accommodation vessels that cater to the different needs of our customers. Our deepwater OA fleet comprises two of the world’s largest comfort-class DP3 semi-submersible accommodation platforms. These vessels boast sophisticated machinery redundancy and platform stability, offering comfortable and safe living, first class crew welfare amenities and “walk-to-work” capability. They are also capable of operating in harsh weather conditions. </p><p>Our shallow water OA fleet consists of four units of our unique DP2 238-pax diesel electric “E-class” accommodation vessels and three units of conventionally moored vessels. In addition, we operate three units of Multi-Purpose Support Vessels (“<strong>MPSV</strong>”) that are capable of supporting subsea work.</p>'

							'<h3>Harbour Services &amp; Emergency Response</h3>' +
							'<p>Our Harbour Services (“<strong>HS</strong>”) department has been operating for over a decade. Together with our joint venture Pacific Workboats, we own, operate and manage a fleet of harbour tugs and heavy lift crane barges, which actively support harbour towage operators and provide heavy lift services to shipyards. In November 2013, we were granted a public towing licence by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore to provide towage services to vessels within the limits of and the approaches to the port of Singapore.</p>' +
							'<p>Our Emergency Response (“<strong>ER</strong>”) department provides worldwide emergency assistance to vessels that require distress support after encountering situations such as collision, oil spillage, grounding or fire damage. We are one of the two main offshore support vessel operators in the world to offer such emergency response services, which include salvage, wreck removal, emergency rescue and oil spill response services.</p>'
